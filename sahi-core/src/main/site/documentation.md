## V4.5.0

On startup a ca.crt will be created in your /userdata/certs directory. You have to import this certificate into your browser. This is pretty simple on Firefox. Just click on the "Download Root CA" link on the startpage and check some boxes. On other browsers it may be more difficult. [Search google](https://www.google.com/search?q=import+certificate+%5Byourbrowser%5D) for how to import the certificate.

When running into problems, delete everything in your /userdata/certs directory and the browser profiles under /userdata/browser.
